# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains two machine learning projects:

1. 📈 **Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression**
2. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Customer Segmentation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**


## 1. 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting future stock prices based on historical data using simple linear regression.

### ✨ Features
- Loads and preprocesses historical stock data
- Applies Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`
- Visualizes the regression line against real data
- Evaluates model accuracy with metrics like RMSE and R² score

### 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn



## 2. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer Segmentation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project performs unsupervised customer segmentation based on behavioral or demographic data using the KNN algorithm.

### ✨ Features
- Preprocessing and feature scaling
- Uses KNN for clustering similar customers
- Visualizes clusters using 2D PCA or t-SNE plots
- Helps businesses understand different customer segments for targeting

### 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
